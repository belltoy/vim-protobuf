vim-protobuf
============

Another vim syntax highlighting for [Google's Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

Introduction
------------

The syntax highlighting code was shamelessly copied from [Google Protocol Buffers repository](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/editors/proto.vim).

This plugin was built for the purpose of making it easy to install.

Installation
------------

* With [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)

```
" .vimrc
Bundle 'belltoy/vim-protobuf'
```
